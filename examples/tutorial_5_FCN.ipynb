        "In a conventional, non-spiking neural network, a supervised, multi-class classification problem takes the neuron with the highest activation and treats that as the predicted class. \n",
        "\n",
        "In a spiking neural net, there are several options to interpreting the output spikes. The most common approaches are:\n",
        "* **Rate coding:** Take the neuron with the highest firing rate (or spike count) as the predicted class\n",
        "* **Latency coding:** Take the neuron that fires *first* as the predicted class\n",
        "\n",
        "This might feel familiar to [Tutorial 1 on neural encoding](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html). The difference is that, here, we are interpreting (decoding) the output spikes, rather than encoding/converting raw input data into spikes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's focus on a rate code. When input data is passed to the network, we want the correct neuron class to emit the most spikes over the course of the simulation run. This then corresponds to the highest average firing frequency. One way to achieve this is to increase the membrane potential of the correct class to $U>U_{\\rm thr}$, and that of incorrect classes to $U<U_{\\rm thr}$. Applying the target to $U$ serves as a proxy for modulating spiking behavior from $S$.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be implemented by taking the softmax of the membrane potential for output neurons, where $C$ is the number of output classes:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$p_i[t] = \\frac{e^{U_i[t]}}{\\sum_{i=0}^{C}e^{U_i[t]}} \\tag{8}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The cross-entropy between $p_i$ and the target $y_i \\in \\{0,1\\}^C$, which is a one-hot target vector, is obtained using:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\mathcal{L}_{CE}[t] = \\sum_{i=0}^Cy_i{\\rm log}(p_i[t]) \\tag{9}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The practical effect is that the membrane potential of the correct class is encouraged to increase while those of incorrect classes are reduced. In effect, this means the correct class is encouraged to fire at all time steps, while incorrect classes are suppressed at all steps. This may not be the most efficient implementation of an SNN, but it is among the simplest.\n",
        "\n",
        "This target is applied at every time step of the simulation, thus also generating a loss at every step. These losses are then summed together at the end of the simulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\mathcal{L}_{CE} = \\sum_t\\mathcal{L}_{CE}[t] \\tag{10}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This is just one of many possible ways to apply a loss function to a spiking neural network. A variety of approaches are available to use in snnTorch (in the module `snn.functional`), and will be the subject of a future tutorial.\n",

The spiking neurons can also be adapted to other layer types, including convolutions and skip connections. Armed with this knowledge, you should now be able to build many different types of SNNs. [In the next tutorial](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html), you will learn how to train a spiking convolutional network, and simplify the amount of code required using the `snn.backprop` module.\n"
